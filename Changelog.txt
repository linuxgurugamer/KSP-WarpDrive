Changelog

	Thanks to user @yaalov for these changes:
		Add Localization

		Add parameters of the WarpDrive in the config of the module
			upgradeStatus
			drivePower
			containmentFieldPower
			Add scaled 5.0m part

		Add four B9PS PartUpgrades instead of the one hardcoded:
			upgradeStatus (Pigeon, Mallard, Osprey, Peregrine)
			drivePower (x1, x2, x4, x8)
			containmentFieldPower (x1, x2, x3, x4)
			Supports of the CTT

		Fixed fov bug, that had appeared on deactivating warpdrive in the map view
